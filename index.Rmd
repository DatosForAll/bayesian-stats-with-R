# Schedule

1. An introduction to Bayesian inference
2. The likelihood
3. Bayesian analyses by hand
4. A detour to explore priors
5. Markov chains Monte Carlo methods (MCMC)
6. Bayesian analyses in `R` with the `Jags` software
7. Contrast scientific hypotheses with model selection
8. Heterogeneity and multilevel models (aka mixed models)

# Learning objectives

* Try and demystify Bayesian statistics, and MCMC methods
* Make the difference between Bayesian and Frequentist analyses
* Understand the Methods section of a paper that does Bayesian stuff
* Run Bayesian analyses with `R` (in `Jags`)

# Requirements

* You need to have [`R`](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [`RStudio`](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed
* Download `Jags` from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/) and install it
* Install the following `R` packages: `tidyverse`, `here`, `lme4` and `R2jags`. You can install them all at once by running the following code in the `R` command line:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "R2jags", "here", "lme4"))
```
